## Background

North Pacific Humpback Whales leave the icy waters around Alaska during the fall, swimming practically non-stop for nearly 6 to 8 weeks before reaching their Hawaiian winter home, where they mate, give birth, and nurture their calves. Their annual migration of about 6,000 miles is one of the longest of any mammal.

In addition to this impressive migration pattern, humpback whales are known for their [vocalizations](http://youtu.be/WabT1L-nN-E). The complexity of these vocalizations, or songs, suggest that the whales are extremely intelligent creatures.

This species are baleen whales and maintain a diet of fish and krill. They can eat up to a ton of food (or 2,000 pounds) of food a day, and newborn humpback calves can eat 100 pounds of their mother's milk a day.

Furthermore, humpback whales live in pods, or groups, and know which whales are part of their pod and which are not. Lastly, some whales have been observed adopting orphaned baby whales, known as calves.
